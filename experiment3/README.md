# Experiment 

This folder contains my third experment - recognize mnist dataset using knn and svm.

## knn

- K = 1 Accuracy = 0.97
- K = 3 Accuracy = 0.94

## svm

I just implement this method - svm, with a bad output, however. 

### Accuracy

- Using linear kernel with 1000 samples: 
- Using rbf kernel with 1000 samples: 

Svm method takes me a lot of time!
